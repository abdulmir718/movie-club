 # Movie Club

Description
-----------------------------

My app is called Movie Club. It is for those who spend more time looking for "the right" movie, than actually watching movies. With my app, users can view popular movies, as well as search for specific movie titles. After selecting a particular movie, the user will be able to read a summary of the movie, as well as view it's release date, rating, genre, and runtime.
